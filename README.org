#+TITLE: check-for-homebrew-alternatives

Want to know which [[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]] casks can replace software already
installed to your =/Applications/= folder? Run this script to
automatically check for Homebrew alternatives. Might not catch 100% of
the Applications, but will give you a good start if you are looking to
use Homebrew for more of the software you have installed.

* Installation

Install with [[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh:
brew install jakevossen5/taps/check-for-homebrew-alternatives
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Just run =check-for-homebrew-alternatives=. It has to make an API
request to every cask, so it will take a while. Be paitent.
